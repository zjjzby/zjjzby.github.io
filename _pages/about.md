I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering at USC. Currently, I am under the guidance of professor [Viktor K. Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). My research interest is high-performance and energy-efficient machine learning acceleration on FPGA and heterogeneous platform. Currently, I focus on sparse linear algebra acceleration on FPGA and graph neural network acceleration on FPGA.

Before I joined USC, I persued my master degree at State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System at Fudan Universty, under the guidance of Professor [Jun Han](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/5f/da/c31145a352218/page.htm) and Professor [Xiaoyang Zeng](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/60/76/c31158a352374/page.htm).

*I am glad to serve as a reviewer for journal or conference papers, as well as a TPC member for conference or workshop, in the area of High Performance Computing, Reconfigurable Computing, Circuit and System, Digital Signal Processing, VLSI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Graph Analytics and Computing, etc. Please feel free to contact me through email: bingyizh@usc.edu
