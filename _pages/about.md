I am AI developer technology engineer in NVIDIA. I obtained my Ph.D. of computer engineering in USC. During my Ph.D., I was under the advisement of professor [Viktor K. Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). My research interest is high performance computing (HPC), compiler, computer architecture, reconfigurable computing, graph machine learning and VLSI. 

Before I joined USC, I persued my master degree at State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System at Fudan Universty, under the guidance of Professor [Jun Han](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/5f/da/c31145a352218/page.htm) and Professor [Xiaoyang Zeng](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/60/76/c31158a352374/page.htm).


I have been invited and served as the reviewer for more than (>) 80 times for various journals and conferences, including: 

- **Journal** (> 70 times):  IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration Systems (TVLSI); IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP); IET Computer Vision; IET Image Processing; Neurocomputing (NEUCOM); Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (EAAI); Information Sciences;  Journal of Electronic Science and Technology; Microelectronics Journal; Microprocessors and Microsystems; 

- **Conference** (>10 papers): ASICON 2021; ICSICT 2022; IEEE international radar conference 2023;
